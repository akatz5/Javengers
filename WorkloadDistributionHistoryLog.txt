Work Divison History Log
Javengers (Kthan Graham, Yasmin Washington, Waylan Corey, Annie Katz)

This document intends to serve as a log of work division, as typically one person pushes to the
main branch for the least complex GitHub merge.
Work created by each member goes into the main branch, and some independently-developed code
resides in each member's branch/fork.

Project 3:
Each team member created their own GUI and we discussed the pros and cons of each. 
Ultimately, one was chosen, but input for the code was provided by each member.
Meetings held: 3
Workload distribution: Even

Project 4:
Each team member works to create the maintenance window using JList.
Kthan provided some setup code to get the team started.
We held a meeting to troubleshoot populating the JLists, as we each had trouble on our own.
Ultimately, we decided we would each try different methods of population, and we settled on 
the method using a JTable over a JList.
